# Experts of GPT2

This project was created for a module in SUTD, NLP 50.040. This project consists of 3 phases:
1) Rebuilding GPT2
2) Running cross lingual transfer tasks (zero-shot, one-shot and few shot)
3) Open-ended extended task

This repository focuses on the open-ended task that was a assigned, and utilizes drop-upcycling methodologies to modify a dense GPT2 model into a spare Mixture-of-Experts model.
